 * 4 players with Piano puzzle completed in safehouse, and 20 achievements unlocked

How To Solve
------------

### Obtain and Display required items in the Safehouse
Specific trophies need to be obtained and displayed to start the initial puzzle:

1. Bain's Guide

   `No Mercy - Normal`

1. The Elephant's Coffer

1. The Healer's Coffer

### Unlock list of "Obsidian" achievements in Safehouse
You need to unlock a list of achievements in safehouse to complete, dictated by
the Obsidian Tablet. Once all the required display items are done (above), goto
the piano in Scarface's office and hit the following keys in order.

![Piano Keys](piano-keys.png)

This will stop the device from rotating. Interacting with the device will reveal
ciphered riddles. These turn out to be required achievements to enable the
secret.  
**Note**: Every time you hit the piano keys, these required achievements list are re-rolled.

You can translate all **20** displayed for your account which appears to be
**individual** (meaning you have to translate), or be safe and just do all
**57** here.
